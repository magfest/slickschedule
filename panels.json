        "description": "#5\u00ad08: The Confirmation (1\u00ad2)\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for level 1\u00ad2.\r\n\r\nAlmost all Pathfinders undergo extensive training for three or more years to learn the tricks of the trade, and their last test before graduating from the ranks of the initiates to the status of a full Pathfinder agent is the Confirmation, a special research project that involves considerable fieldwork and is designed to simulate the initiates' future work as a Pathfinder. Even the noteworthy field commissioned agents sometimes participate in such trials as a way to familiarize themselves with the Pathfinder Society\u2019s rules and expectations. Although Confirmation is typically an individual affair, the society recently discovered a site on the Isle of Kortos that would be perfect for initiates but perhaps too dangerous to handle alone. Successfully uncovering this site\u2019s secrets will not only contribute to the society\u2019s body of knowledge but shape the exciting careers ahead for each of the prospective agents.\r\n\r\nWritten by Kyle Baird.\r\n\r\nPhantom Phenomena (1)\r\n\r\nA series of six Quests designed for 1st\u00adlevel characters. These quick adventures will be available for beginners throughout MAGFEst.\r\n\r\nBizarre phenomena have tormented the people of southeastern Ustalav for decades, and these events become stronger and more dangerous every year. Hoping to uncover the origins of these flashes of red lightning and spectral hauntings, Dr. Quolorum from the Sincomakti School of Sciences has set out with a team of able\u00ad-bodied assistants. Can the PCs help the professor unlock the secret that dwells above Lantern Lake?\r\n\r\nPhantom Phenomena includes six, 1\u00adhour adventures that take the PCs to a superstitious village, a lightning-scarred woodland, an ancient Kellid monolith, a haunted manor, an occult university, and finally into the storm-choked mountains.  Experience the adventures in any order to create a unique story.\r\n\r\nThese Quests are designed for play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, but can easily be adapted for use with any world.\r\n\r\nWritten by Brian Duckwitz, Cole Kronewitter, and Nicholas Milasich.",

It's up to the PCs to navigate Diobel\u2014a proud town run by cutthroat smugglers\u2014earn the defector's trust, and deal a telling blow to their Aspis foes.\r\n\r\n\"The Consortium Compact\" is an evergreen, replayable scenario designed to help introduce players to the Pathfinder Society, the Isle of Kortos, and one of the Society's longstanding rivals.\r\n\r\nWritten by Mike Kimmel.\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1\u00ad5.\r\n\r\nThe metropolis of Absalom promotes commerce in its many forms, and although slavery is legal, it is increasingly common for citizens to frown on the institution. The practice becomes more questionable when an ally of the Pathfinder Society traces an attempt at supernatural surveillance through a slave. Sent as independent sleuths, the PCs must track down the source of this espionage, which takes them deep into underbelly of one of Absalom\u2019s darkest industries.\r\n\r\nContent in \u201cSlave Ships of Absalom\u201d also contributes directly to the ongoing storylines of the Liberty\u2019s Edge and Sovereign Court factions.\r\n\r\nWritten by Mark Garringer.\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1\u00ad5.\r\n\r\nLess than a decade ago, the Pathfinder Society established a lodge in Nirmathas, an act that infuriated the\r\nnation's expansionist rival Molthune. The latter outlawed the Society soon after, and ever since Pathfinders\r\nhave relied on smugglers like the Varisian entrepreneur Guaril Karela to slip supplies past the Molthuni\r\nblockade for both the lodge and the Society's war\u00adtorn neighbors. Something has intercepted those shipments.\r\nCan the PCs uncover the culprit and save the Society's reputation in Nirmathas?\r\n\r\nContent in \"Trouble in Tamran\" also ties into a special metaplot element from Pathfinder Society Special #6\u201398: Serpents Rise. Players who have completed that special event are encouraged to bring its Chronicle sheet when playing this adventure.\r\n\r\nWritten by Benjamin Bruck.\r\n\r\nPhantom Phenomena (1)\r\n\r\nA series of six Quests designed for 1st\u00adlevel characters. These quick adventures will be available for beginners throughout MAGFest.\r\n\r\nBizarre phenomena have tormented the people of southeastern Ustalav for decades, and these events become stronger and more dangerous every year. Hoping to uncover the origins of these flashes of red lightning and spectral hauntings, Dr. Quolorum from the Sincomakti School of Sciences has set out with a team of able\u00adbodied assistants. Can the PCs help the professor unlock the secret that dwells above Lantern Lake?\r\n\r\nPhantom Phenomena includes six, 1\u00adhour adventures that take the PCs to a superstitious village, a lightning-\r\nscarred woodland, an ancient Kellid monolith, a haunted manor, an occult university, and finally into the storm-\r\nchoked mountains. Experience the adventures in any order to create a unique story.\r\n\r\nThese Quests are designed for play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, but can easily be adapted for use with any world.\r\n\r\nWritten by Brian Duckwitz, Cole Kronewitter, and Nicholas Milasich.",

Can the PCs navigate the complex social landscape of Absalom's elite and gain access to the mysterious vault known as the Conundrum, or will they face public ridicule or worse in the face of the steepest competition in the Inner Sea?\r\n\r\nWritten by Larry Wilhelm.\r\n\r\n#5\u00ad11: Library of the Lion (1\u00ad5)\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1\u20135.\r\n\r\nFew societies have so vaunted a tradition of leading crusades as Taldor, yet the constant revisions to its history by scheming factions leaves the truth obscured by countless acts of political modifications. Even the lauded Kitharodian Academy\u2019s texts are riddled with these changes, so when a secretive ally approaches the Pathfinder Society with information about a hidden archive that contains the unaltered histories, the Pathfinders plan a daring infiltration to recover the secrets of Taldor\u2019s past victories so that Mendev might benefit from the discovery.\r\n\r\nContent in \"Library of the Lion\" also contributes directly to the ongoing storylines of the Cheliax, Grand Lodge, and Taldor factions.\r\n\r\nWritten by Kyle Elliot.\r\n\r\n#2\u00ad-21: The Dalsine Affair (1\u00ad-5)\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 1st to 7th level characters (Tiers: 1\u00ad2, 3\u00ad4 and 6\u00ad7).\r\n\r\nYour mission takes you to the Taldan capital city of Oppara where the intricate web of political intrigue and ages\u00adold religious conflicts threaten the Pathfinder Society\u2019s presence in the land. When Baron Jacquo Dalsine\u2019s cousin is implicated in a recent attack on Society allies, the situation becomes even tighter for the Pathfinders, and at the end of the day some members of the Dalsine family may not get out unscathed.\r\n\r\nWritten by Alex Greenshields.\r\n\r\nPhantom Phenomena (1)\r\n\r\nA series of six Quests designed for 1st\u00adlevel characters. These quick adventures will be available for beginners throughout MAGFest.\r\n\r\nBizarre phenomena have tormented the people of southeastern Ustalav for decades, and these events become stronger and more dangerous every year. Hoping to uncover the origins of these flashes of red lightning and spectral hauntings, Dr. Quolorum from the Sincomakti School of Sciences has set out with a team of able\u00adbodied assistants. Can the PCs help the professor unlock the secret that dwells above Lantern Lake?\r\n\r\nPhantom Phenomena includes six, 1\u00adhour adventures that take the PCs to a superstitious village, a lightning-\r\nscarred woodland, an ancient Kellid monolith, a haunted manor, an occult university, and finally into the storm-\r\nchoked mountains. Experience the adventures in any order to create a unique story.\r\n\r\nThese Quests are designed for play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, but can easily be adapted for use with any world.\r\n\r\nWritten by Brian Duckwitz, Cole Kronewitter, and Nicholas Milasich.",

The cycle continues until he has earned a righteous place in the afterlife. After years of service and lifetimes of accomplishment, Venture-Captain Bakten nears the end of his noble existence and has begun investigating his past lives as a means of understanding Tian Xia's rich history. However, he cannot complete his research alone, and only with the PCs' assistance can they decipher the region's past.\r\n\r\n\"The Lost Legacy\" is the first scenario in the two-part To Judge a Soul campaign arc. It is followed by Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-08: To Judge a Soul, Part 2: Karma Reclaimed and is intended to be played in order.\r\n\r\nWritten by Scott Sharplin.\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 5-9.\r\n\r\nA recent attack on the Grand Lodge became all the more heinous when one of the invading agents employed an eldritch relic to abduct a high-ranking Pathfinder. In order to release the captive, the Society must understand the relic and track down the fleeing operative\u2014a mission that leads the PCs into Absalom's most prestigious archives to uncover a dark secret.\r\n\r\nContent in \"The Blakros Connection\" also ties into a special metaplot element from Pathfinder Society Special #6-98: Serpents Rise. Players who have completed that special event are encouraged to bring its Chronicle sheet when playing this adventure.\r\n\r\nWritten by Robert Brookes\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 1st to 5th level characters (Tiers: 1\u20132, 4\u20135).\r\n\r\nThe Pathfinder Society seeks the ancient ruby ring of the salamander and it falls to a team of Pathfinders to find it. Last seen in the Tri-Towers Yard, a once elite academy for the youth of Absalom, the ruby ring is now lost in the Drownyard, all that remains of Tri-Towers after it was destroyed a decade ago in the great quake. The Pathfinders must risk the strange black ichors and salty brine to find their prize\u2014will they risk their very souls as well?\r\n\r\nWritten by Tim and Eileen Connors.\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for level 1-2.\r\n\r\nAlmost all Pathfinders undergo extensive training for three or more years to learn the tricks of the trade, and their last test before graduating from the ranks of the initiates to the status of a full Pathfinder agent is the Confirmation, a special research project that involves considerable fieldwork and is designed to simulate the initiates' future work as a Pathfinder. Even the noteworthy field commissioned agents sometimes participate in such trials as a way to familiarize themselves with the Pathfinder Society\u2019s rules and expectations. Although Confirmation is typically an individual affair, the society recently discovered a site on the Isle of Kortos that would be perfect for initiates but perhaps too dangerous to handle alone. Successfully uncovering this site\u2019s secrets will not only contribute to the society\u2019s body of knowledge but shape the exciting careers ahead for each of the prospective agents.\r\n\r\nWritten by Kyle Baird\r\n\r\nA series of six Quests designed for 1st\u00adlevel characters. These quick adventures will be available for beginners throughout MAGFest.\r\n\r\nBizarre phenomena have tormented the people of southeastern Ustalav for decades, and these events become stronger and more dangerous every year. Hoping to uncover the origins of these flashes of red lightning and spectral hauntings, Dr. Quolorum from the Sincomakti School of Sciences has set out with a team of able\u00adbodied assistants. Can the PCs help the professor unlock the secret that dwells above Lantern Lake?\r\n\r\nPhantom Phenomena includes six, 1\u00adhour adventures that take the PCs to a superstitious village, a lightning-\r\nscarred woodland, an ancient Kellid monolith, a haunted manor, an occult university, and finally into the storm-\r\nchoked mountains. Experience the adventures in any order to create a unique story.\r\n\r\nThese Quests are designed for play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, but can easily be adapted for use with any world.\r\n\r\nWritten by Brian Duckwitz, Cole Kronewitter, and Nicholas Milasich.",

While the games may have started off as an \"easier\" side story within the apocalyptic Shin Megami Tensei universe, Atlus often likes to insert \"easter eggs\" into the plots and characters of the Persona game series. Mixed in with the shadows and fog lies elements of Carl Jung, the mythic journey, gender roles/perception, rumormongering, nods to international folklore, and foundations of psychological fear, despair, and deception. (For example, Personas 3 and 4 have taken a similar myth of descending into the otherworld (Orpheus and Izanagi) and crafted two very different narrative designs, each with their own consequences, and statements about the world.)

It is up to the Pathfinders to ascend into the ice-capped mountains to unveil the crimes of past generations and save one of the region's greatest heroes.\r\n\r\n\"Karma Reclaimed\" is the second scenario in the two-part To Judge a Soul campaign arc. It is preceded by Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-06: To Judge a Soul, Part 1: The Lost Legacy and is intended to be played in order.\r\n\r\nWritten by Larry Wilhelm.\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 5-9.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pathfinder Society acquires a copy of A Thread of Silver, a written survey of some of Numeria's most closely guarded sites, the Technic League dispatches its own agents to the Pathfinder lodge in Nantambu to recover the text and make an example of those who would investigate Numeria's otherworldly secrets. Can the PCs prevent the League from stealing this valuable tome and destroying the Society's foothold in the Mwangi Expanse? For levels 5-9.\r\n\r\nWritten by Kyle Baird.\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1\u20135.\r\n\r\nA veteran Pathfinder exploring the Fenwall Mountains of Varisia has begun sleepwalking, traveling through the dead of night in the same direction each time. The following mornings, however, he awakens injured and lost in the wilderness, never reaching the mysterious destination that drew him from his bed in the night. Something is calling Kalkamedes, something powerful, but unless he can make it safely to the source of his somnambulism, that power will remain a mystery. It falls to a team of Pathfinders to escort the sleepwalker to his destination and uncover the true nature of the strange phenomenon overtaking Kalkamedes's dreams.\r\n\r\nWritten by Michael Kortes.\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1\u20132.\r\n\r\nMore than 400 years have transpired since the Pathfinder Society began in a humble tavern that has quietly weathered the centuries without incident. When a routine errand there uncovers a clue left behind by one of the founding Pathfinders, it\u2019s up to the PCs to solve a puzzle whose pieces are scattered across Absalom\u2014and whose prize dates back to the Society\u2019s darkest years.\r\n\r\n\"The Wounded Wisp\" is an evergreen, replayable scenario designed to help introduce players to the history of the Pathfinder Society and Absalom\u2019s greatest sites.\r\n\r\nWritten by Thurston Hillman.\r\n\r\nA series of six Quests designed for 1st-level characters. These quick adventures will be available for beginners throughout MAGFEst.\r\n\r\nBizarre phenomena have tormented the people of southeastern Ustalav for decades, and these events become stronger and more dangerous every year. Hoping to uncover the origins of these flashes of red lightning and spectral hauntings, Dr. Quolorum from the Sincomakti School of Sciences has set out with a team of able-bodied assistants. Can the PCs help the professor unlock the secret that dwells above Lantern Lake?\r\n\r\nPhantom Phenomena includes six, 1-hour adventures that take the PCs to a superstitious village, a lightning-scarred woodland, an ancient Kellid monolith, a haunted manor, an occult university, and finally into the storm-choked mountains. Experience the adventures in any order to create a unique story.\r\n\r\nThese Quests are designed for play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, but can easily be adapted for use with any world.\r\n\r\nWritten by Brian Duckwitz, Cole Kronewitter, and Nicholas Milasich.\r\n\r\nPathfinder Adventure Card Guild: Season of the Righteous\r\n\r\n\t#1-1A: Cloven Trail\r\n\t#1-1B: Instant Inquisition\r\n\r\nThe Worldwound is a land beset by demons from the Abyss, but in the nearby city of Kenabres, crusaders gather to test their mettle. You have joined the Fourth Crusade, answering the call of High Queen Galfrey. The goddess Iomedae has also taken a personal interest in Abyssal incursions threatening the city, dispatching a herald known as the Hand of the Inheritor to bolster the courage of those who would face the demonic hordes. With martial skill, magical might, and a little but of luck, your band of adventures now have an opportunity to liberate the Worldwound and save the world.",

However, a recent discovery by the Pathfinder Society has revealed a brief opportunity to navigate the columns safely and search for the lost treasure of the legendary pirate Sevenfingers. The only problem is that the Pathfinders are not the only visitors to the Gloomspires.\r\n\r\nWritten by Tom Phillips.\r\n\r\n#6-08: The Segang Expedition (1-5)\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1\u20135.\r\n\r\nRumors of a lost shrine in the Segang Jungle draw the Pathfinder Society\u2019s attention, but the prohibitive cost of sending a team into the wilds of Jalmeray threatens to shut down the expedition before it even begins. Fortunately, a wealthy patron has offered to fund the PCs travel expenses in return for their help in his decades-old quest. Can the Pathfinders balance this new obligation with their exploration of the archaeological site?\r\n\r\nContent in \u201cThe Segang Expedition\u201d also contributes directly to the ongoing storyline of the Sovereign Court faction.\r\n\r\nWritten by Benjamin Bruck.\r\n\r\nA Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for Levels 3\u20137.\r\n\r\nAbsalom is Golarion\u2019s busiest and most populous city, but one of its largest populations goes largely unnoticed. You must venture into the sewers beneath the City at the Center of the World to stop the meddling dragons within from disrupting a vital Pathfinder Society operation.\r\n\r\nWritten by Dennis Baker.\r\n\r\nA series of six Quests designed for 1st-level characters. These quick adventures will be available for beginners throughout MAGFEst.\r\n\r\nBizarre phenomena have tormented the people of southeastern Ustalav for decades, and these events become stronger and more dangerous every year. Hoping to uncover the origins of these flashes of red lightning and spectral hauntings, Dr. Quolorum from the Sincomakti School of Sciences has set out with a team of able-bodied assistants. Can the PCs help the professor unlock the secret that dwells above Lantern Lake?\r\n\r\nPhantom Phenomena includes six, 1-hour adventures that take the PCs to a superstitious village, a lightning-scarred woodland, an ancient Kellid monolith, a haunted manor, an occult university, and finally into the storm-choked mountains. Experience the adventures in any order to create a unique story.\r\n\r\nThese Quests are designed for play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, but can easily be adapted for use with any world.\r\n\r\nWritten by Brian Duckwitz, Cole Kronewitter, and Nicholas Milasich.\r\n\r\nThe Worldwound is a land beset by demons from the Abyss, but in the nearby city of Kenabres, crusaders gather to test their mettle. You have joined the Fourth Crusade, answering the call of High Queen Galfrey. The goddess Iomedae has also taken a personal interest in Abyssal incursions threatening the city, dispatching a herald known as the Hand of the Inheritor to bolster the courage of those who would face the demonic hordes. With martial skill, magical might, and a little but of luck, your band of adventures now have an opportunity to liberate the Worldwound and save the world.",
